Last month, we wrote about our small grants program, in which we're looking to fund implementation projects involving pluggable transports. This month, we are looking to extend this program with our remaining funds, to also include research into **new** pluggable transports.

So, as well as the [implementation grants](/blog/small-grants-program/), we can now fund research activity. Specifically, we're looking for projects that will bring you at least to a proof-of-concept as an output.

As before, grants can be up to 6 months in duration. Most projects should aim for a budget of $25,000 USD, but exceptions can be made. Final project timelines and funding are dependent upon available funds and grant timelines.

| **Full list of activities eligible for funding** |
|-----|
|Research into potential new transports, with at least a proof of concept as an output|
|Implementation of new transports (*must* conform to the 2.x spec and provide a self-assessment based on the [Evaluation Criteria](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/PluggableTransports/PTEvaluationCriteria)|
|Updating of existing transports to the 2.x spec|
|Implementing pluggable transports in applications providing security, privacy, or access to information.|

For more information, or to apply, visit [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/pluggabletransports](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/pluggabletransports). We will review applications on a first-come, first-served basis, while funding remains.
