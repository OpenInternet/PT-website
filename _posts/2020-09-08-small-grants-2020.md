Internews is pleased to announce a new Small Grants program for projects involving pluggable transports. 
 
The following categories are eligible for funding to support projects across different stages of development.

1. Concept Development for new transports  
2. Proof of Concept deployments   
3. Deployment, App integration, and cross-platform functionality  
4. Improving PT deployment and infrastructure stability

Transports and applications funded through this work must use an open source license, must not rely on domain fronting, and must conform to the 2.1 spec (or future draft specs) and provide a self-assessment based on the Evaluation Criteria here: [https://www.pluggabletransports.info/build/](https://www.pluggabletransports.info/build/). 

Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis with a deadline for the first round of submissions being October 2, 2020. Grants can be budgeted for 3-12 months in duration, with the potential for extension following the first year The project budget should be under $30,000 but exceptions can be made. 

For more information, or to apply, visit [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1j_UOvnk55PaKNHfwPNRMjWB-F2r0TxySb80dipcb3M4/edit?ts=5f50f895). We will review applications on a first-come, first-served basis, while funding remains.

Don't forget to also consider joining us for the [Implementers' Meeting 2020](/blog/ptim2020/), where you can also sign up for a Lightning Talk to present your Small Grants idea!
