The current version of the Pluggable Transports specification is [here](https://github.com/Pluggable-Transports/Pluggable-Transports-spec), and is at version 2.1

We are now looking for community input for revising the specification. There are already some comments on Github. These proposed changes will also be distributed via the Network Traffic Obfuscation community [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/traffic-obf) in order to collect feedback and reflect them on the next version of the spec.
