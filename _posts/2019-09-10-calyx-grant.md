Calyx recently [made an announcement](https://calyxinstitute.org/news/were-improving-calyxvpn) that they are adding support for Pluggable Transports to their product [CalyxVPN](https://calyx.net/).

CalyxVPN is a free VPN tool that helps people access information in places where content may be censored, provided by [The Calyx Institute](https://www.calyxinstitute.org/). The team will be working with developers from the [LEAP Encryption Access Project](https://leap.se/), which will also lead to other VPNs that use the Bitmask client being able to benefit from this work.

Stay tuned for more announcements as our other funded projects get off the ground!
