There's been a big update to Redjack's [Marionette](https://www.github.com/redjack/marionette) on Github. The repository, which contains a Go port of the programmable network proxy, has been updated to fix some issues with active probing defenses, and now also includes extensive documentation.

The docs give step-by-step instructions for using Marionette, from building simple "Hello World" protocols through to full application simulations. We have also published our own guide to installing both the [server](/implement/marionette-server) and [client](/implement/marionette-client).
